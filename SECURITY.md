## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Contact the maintainers at `security@localhost` (replace with your contact email) or open a private/hidden issue on GitHub.

If you'd like, I can add a PGP key or GitHub security policy instructions.

## Sensitive Data
- Do not commit `.env` or other credential files. A local `.env` file is in `.gitignore`.
- Use environment variables or secret managers for production deployments.
