Thank you for considering contributing!

- Fork the repo and open a feature branch.
- Run the app locally (see `README.md`) and run `composer install` to get dev tools.
- Keep changes small and focused; include tests where appropriate.
- Open a Pull Request describing the change and its motivation.
- Code style: follow PSR-12 / use `php-cs-fixer` (configured via composer scripts).

If you'd like me to add contributor guidelines or templates, tell me which workflow you'd prefer.
